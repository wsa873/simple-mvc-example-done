// require mongoose, a popular MongoDB library for nodejs

// variable to hold our Model
// A Model is our data structure to handle data.
// This can be an object, JSON, XML or anything else.
// A mongoDB model is a Mongo database structure with the API attached
// That is, a model has built-in functions for
// its data structure like find, findOne, etc.
// Usually you will retrieve data from the database through the Model object
let CatModel = {};

/* While Mongo is a schema-less database, meaning
   we can just store arbitrary objects in it, Mongoose
   does implement a schema system. If you
   wanted to just store arbitrary objects you could just use
   the mongoDB NodeJS driver: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb

   Information about the differences between MongoDB Driver and Mongoose found here:
   https://www.mongodb.com/developer/article/mongoose-versus-nodejs-driver/

   The schema enforces a semi-rigid format on our data
   so that it is more of a "known quantity". This
   puts us somewhere between the very rigid SQL
   format and the very loose Mongo format.

   To create the schema we give it an object. Each
   top level key (like name, bedsOwned, and createdDate)
   defines a variable our objects can have. We then
   use individual objects to define the features and parameters
   of each one of those variables.

   For our name, we define a type of String. This means name
   is a string. Since mongo stores javascript
   objects, the type usually does not matter. However, this is
   something added by Mongoose to clarify what each
   variable should contain. We also give it the required option,
   which means every object in the cat database MUST
   have a name. We set the trim option to true, which
   will remove trailing and leading whitespace from the string.
   Finally we set the unique option to true. This means that
   there cannot be two cats with the same name.

   For our bedsOwned, we say it is a number. We set the minimum value to 0. We say it is required.

   For our createdDate, we want to store the time that
   the cat was first added to the database. Rather than
   figure that out in our own code when we create each cat,
   we can instead set it's default to the Date.now function.

   When a new cat is made, it will execute the default function and return the current date.

  },

});
// Create the cat model based on the schema. You provide it with a custom discriminator
// (the name of the object type. Can be anything)
// and the schema to make a model from.
// Look at the model variable definition above for more details.
CatModel = mongoose.model('Cat', CatSchema);

// We only want to export the cat model, so we can overwrite the entire exports object.
